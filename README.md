# custom-html-banners
Some various sample banners I made in my free time, made using HTML, CSS and Javascript! I plan to keep adding to this library based on new things that I keep learning. Look forward to more updates!

## How it works
There are 4 banners you'll find at the moment with the details as follows:-

### Tekken 7 Banner
1. Animated door opening
2. Ring Background
3. Heihachi and Jin Kazama (Characters from the game) animated into the frame clashing
4. A "Welcome to the king of iron fist tournament 7" message using the tarrget.ttf font (https://www.dafont.com/tarrget.font to download! Shout out to the author for this amazing font)
5. Lightning imagery and audio played after every click on the banner [2.5 secon delay]
6. A stop button to remove the lightning and reset + pause the audio

### SnowBros Banner
1. Animated snow background set to a repeat pattern based on the x-axis
2. SnowBros font text in the center with a unique orange highlight (https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/778160/snow_bros to download! Again great font)
3. Banner border highlighted with Firebrick colour when selected
4. Snowbros theme started on clicking the banner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDQJWwkM16E for the audio)
5. Snowbros theme paused on clicking the border highlighted banner again

### Peach Banner [Differences from SnowBros Banner]
1. Animation goes along the y-axis instead
2. Lightpink border on clicking banner
3. Audio is Peaches castle from the n64 console [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0y3-qHEVYU]

### Mario Banner [Differences from SnowBros Banner]
1. Animation goes along the x-axis & y-axis instead
2. DarkRed border on clicking banner
3. Audio is super mario bros stage 1-1 from the NES console [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT3NA5Q08mk]

### General Functionality
- Only one active border is highlighted at a time. This identifies which banners audio is being played or paused
- Hovering on a banner highlights it, and 2 banners can have a border highlighted at the same time, but once the banner hovered upon is clicked, all other banner borders are removed and the new highlighted banner is bordered with its audio set to play
- The tekken banner does not have any border, but on clicking other banners, the lightning image and audio is removed & paused respectively
- The peach and mario banner are responsive to different screen sizes

That's all I have for now. It was a fun experience making this, and I aim to keep adding more in the future while I learn and get hit by the curiosity bug. Hope this project gives you as much or more enjoyment as it did for me! Would also appreciate any feedback you might have!
